# Vaultwarden Backup with Github Actions

> [!NOTE] 
> - Backup single source vault account data to Github's repo; then import to another destination vault account.
> - You can use this to sync from Vaultwarden to Bitwarden, and vice versa.
> - We are using **Github Actions**üõ°Ô∏è for automation. GitHub is all you need. (You don't need a server to run this.)
> - The workflow is divided into 2 parts: `Export Vault to Repo` and `Purge Vault and Import from Repo`; you can choose as you need.
> - The workflow is using **Bitwarden CLI**[^1] to export and import JSON files.

> [!Warning]
> - The destination vault will be purged before import!


## Export Encrypted JSON from vaultwarden/bitwarden to Github repo üì§

- workflow name: `Export Vault to Repo`
- triggered by cron job, everyday at 21:53am UTC by default
- it will export an encrypted (using `JSON_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD`) JSON named with timestamp: `backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`
- compare the hash value to check whether it's new
- and save them under `vault_backup`

## Purge and Import Encrypted JSON to vaultwarden/bitwarden from Github repo üì•

- workflow name: `Purge Vault and Import from Repo`
- triggered by the successful of the `Export Vault to Repo` workflow
- and if there is a new git push to the repo, otherwise stop the workflow
- it will delete ALL items (move to trash) belong to the default owner of the destination vault
- the items of other owners(organizations) will not be affected
- find the latest JSON file in the backup folder `vault_backup`
- import it to the destination vault

## Github Acitons Secrets üîë

Your Repository Settings --> Secrets and Variables --> Actions --> New Repository Secret

- JSON_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD: 
  - the password to encrypt during the export and import of JSON
- SOURCE_CLIENT_ID: 
  - the `client_id`, which can be found in the vault settings 
- SOURCE_CLIENT_SECRET: 
  - the `client_secret`, together with `client_id`
- SOURCE_PASSWORD: 
  - the Master Password to login
- SOURCE_SERVER_URL: 
  - the source host url, e.g., `https://vault.myhost.net`
- The following items are similar to above, as the destination's parameters.
  - DEST_CLIENT_ID
  - DEST_CLIENT_SECRET
  - DEST_PASSWORD
  - DEST_SERVER_URL

## Getting Started üöÄ

- create a **private repo** in your Github
- copy the two workflow files to the folder `.github/workflows`:
  - `Export Vault to Repo - CompareHashes.yml`
  - `Purge Vault and Import from Repo - OnNewPush.yml`
- copy the first only if you don't need to import data to another vault
- it will just backup your vault data into the repo backup folder
- adjust the cron schedule as your preference (optional)
- setup the action secrets as mentioned above
- make sure the workflows are enabled
- done.

## Changelog üìù

- 2025.06.07 v1.5
